Having this blog has really forced me to examine the way I write. When I write a story or a paper, I just use some text editor and save only the latest copy. When I code something, I maintain all versions of the code and have the ability to branch that code. Since both processes are ultimately just manipulations of text, why did they differ? And why didn’t I use Git to write my short stories in college? (I did, however, write them in SublimeText. Thank you based distraction free mode.)

I was texting Mike about this a couple days ago and he mentioned that he always assumed that authors used version control though didn’t know what software that they used. He also mentioned a great market for this type of product – law firms. With the amount of paperwork that they handle and track, it’d be a no-brainer for them to have some form of version control on their documents.

This got me thinking about my own work experiences. At the lab, we do have a database for drawings (P&IDs, blueprints, calculations, etc) that has a basic form of versioning – any time a user uploads a new file under an existing document number, the databases stores and labels that file with the latest revision number. While this is undoubtedly useful for maintaining official documents, it is less helpful for an individual just trying to draft paper.

So, I looked around for a product that filled this niche. Guess what I found? Draft, a Y-Combinator backed online text-editor, complete with version control. Can’t say I’m surprised, but take a look.

It’s clean, minimalist web app that’s simple to use. It’s even got what they call a Hemingway Mode based off the Hemingway-esque advice Write drunk; edit sober. This function disables any ability to edit the document and forces the user to do what they should be doing – writing. I’m definitely going to use this app and function the next time I write a story.

While switching to an entirely new word processor is viable for individuals, students, and maybe companies with flexibility, I know that my work wouldn’t be able to take such a “radical” change. Again, Mike had a pretty genius idea just adding an extension to MS Word that gave it that functionality. Anyone want to collaborate on this project? Just comment or message us!
