First post of the New Year! And it's a short one...

Recently, I've decided to actually care more about my text editor and download some packages to make life easier (or just make Sublime look better). Here is my definitive guide on what to get:

#### Essential
- [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)
  - Makes it easier to download packages for Sublime Text.
- [Origami](https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami)
  - Allows multiple panes on the same Sublime window
- [Modific](https://github.com/gornostal/Modific)
  - Highlights changes against your last Git (or Mercurial) commit
- [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme)
  - It just looks good
- [Material Theme App Bar](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme-appbar)
  - Awesome looking side bar that matches Material Theme

#### If you develop in JavaScript and build stuff with React
- [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime)
  - Syntax highlighting for ES6 and JSX
- [JSHint Gutter](https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-JSHint)
  - JavaScript linter. Saved me a few times...

#### Things you should use but don't want to
- [Vintage](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html)
  - Vim emulator that actually comes with Sublime...

Happy coding!
