Sorry for the click bait, I just couldn't help myself. Mike and I actually spent some time debating what would be better, 'How I Coded For 159 Days Straight and Got A Job', 'How I got Rejected From 40 Companies and Still Got A Job', etc. The possibilities were endless.

Here's the good stuff though:

**159** day streak on GitHub (starting from App Academy)

**139** job application sent out

**94** companies that ignored me

**40** rejections

**11** phone screens

**9** final interviews

**5** offers

**1** job

It's been a long road transition from a chemical engineer to a software dev but it's finally turning into a reality! On Monday, I start my first day at [Course Hero](https://coursehero.com). I'm really excited!
