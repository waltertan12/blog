For the past week and a half, I've noticed a plastic bag full of chobanis placed clumsily on the door shelf of the work refrigerator. I've never seen chobani in there before, other than mine, and thought, "Cool, someone else eats chobani besides me."

Well, day after day I've looked at this pile of greek yogurt and found it quite suspicious that the number of yogurts never diminished.&nbsp;It was like this: Monday, 5 yogurts; Tuesday, 5 yogurts; Wednesday, 5 yogurts; etc.&nbsp;Who brings yogurt to work and doesn't eat them? 

Today, curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to look into the bag, just to see the flavors. The first one that caught my eye was passion fruit. I remembered buying the exact same flavor yogurt a couple weeks ago but never eating it. I also remembering finding it odd I never ate it that flavor and guessed I lost that yogurt, whatever that meant.

Then, it hit me.

These were my yogurts. I put them in a plastic grocery bag, I brought them to work, and I put them in the fridge the Friday before a long weekend...

Anyway, it really is a strange feeling when you lose and find something all in the same moment.
